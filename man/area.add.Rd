\title{Add areas to a Spatial Polygons Data Frame}
\usage{
area.add(spdf, area.ha = T, area.sqkm = T, byid = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{spdf}{Spatial Polygons Data Frame to calculate areas for}

\item{area.ha}{Logical. If \code{T}, areas will be calculated and added in hectares. Default is \code{T}.}

\item{area.sqkm}{Logical. If \code{T}, areas will be calculated and added in square kilometers. Default is \code{T}.}

\item{byid}{Logical. If \code{T}, areas will be calculated and added for each polygon by ID. If \code{F} the area of the whole SPDF will be calculated and added, so every value for that field will be the same, regardless of polygon ID. Default is \code{T}.}
}
\value{
The original Spatial Polygons Data Frame with an additional field for each area unit calculated.
}
\description{
This function takes a Spatial Polygons Data Frame and calculates and adds area fields to the data frame. Areas can be calculated either treating the whole SPDF as a unit or for each polygon individually.
